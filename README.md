# Weather API

## Description
This weather api solves the problems of a modern weather app, although small, it functions as a getter for the basic information that a person needs for going outside. It involves the use of temperature and icon weather conditions to tell the outside weather of a city. This is useful as people can just refresh the page and type in another value in order to correctly use this application. I hope to develop this in the future by adding local storage. I learned that even through you fail at populating the api, you have to try and use the docs to find and reference the error that you are having.

## installation guide

In order to use the api, you have to search a location of a city and the api populates the selected tabs with information. It searches for the first result so please be specific and limit spelling errors.
